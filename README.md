# Optical Multilayer Exploration Software.

Created by David C. Heson, Jack Liu, and Dr. William M. Robertson over the 2022 MTSU Computational Sciences REU (NSF REU Award #1757493).

Codebase created to explore the optical properties of multilayers and optimize their design to achieve maximum sensibilities, using minimas of reflected light and RIU (Refractive Index Unit) as qualitative measurements. A new measurement called SWT (Shift With Thickness) was also introdued, which is defined as the degree or nanometer shift in the location of a Bloch Surface Wave when the bottom layer increases by 10 nanometers in thickness.
